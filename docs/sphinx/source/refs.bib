    journal = {Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering},
    abstract = {Comprehensive investigations of crystalline systems often require methods bridging atomistic and continuum scales. In this context, coarse-grained mesoscale approaches are of particular interest as they allow the examination of large systems and time scales while retaining some microscopic details. The so-called phase-field crystal (PFC) model conveniently describes crystals at diffusive time scales through a continuous periodic field which varies on atomic scales and is related to the atomic number density. To go beyond the restrictive atomic length scales of the PFC model, a complex amplitude formulation was first developed by Goldenfeld et al (2005 Phys. Rev. E 72 020601). While focusing on length scales larger than the lattice parameter, this approach can describe crystalline defects, interfaces, and lattice deformations. It has been used to examine many phenomena including liquid/solid fronts, grain boundary energies, and strained films. This topical review focuses on this amplitude expansion of the PFC model and its developments. An overview of the derivation, connection to the continuum limit, representative applications, and extensions is presented. A few practical aspects, such as suitable numerical methods and examples, are illustrated as well. Finally, the capabilities and bounds of the model, current challenges, and future perspectives are addressed.}

    journal = {Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering},
    abstract = {We derive a phase field crystal model that couples the diffusive evolution of a microscopic structure with the fast dynamics of a macroscopic velocity field, explicitly accounting for the relaxation of elastic excitations. This model captures better than previous formulations the dynamics of complex interfaces and dislocations in single crystals as well as grain boundary migration in poly-crystals where the long-range elastic field is properly relaxed. The proposed model features a diffusivity that depends non-linearly on the local phase. It induces more localized interfaces between a disordered phase (liquid-like) and an ordered phase, e.g., stripes or crystal lattices. For stripes, the interface dynamics are shown to be strongly anisotropic. We also show that the model is able to evolve the classical PFC at mechanical equilibrium. However, in contrast to previous approaches, it is not restricted to a single-crystal configuration or small distortions from a fixed reference lattice. To showcase the capabilities of this approach, we consider a few examples, from the annihilation of dislocation loops in a single crystal at mechanical equilibrium to the relaxation of a microstructure including crystalline domains with different orientations and grain boundaries. During the self-annihilation of a mixed type dislocation loop (i.e., not shear or prismatic), long-range elastic effects cause the loop to move out of plane before the annihilation event.}

    abstract = {In many processes for crystalline materials such as precipitation, heteroepitaxy, alloying, and phase transformation, lattice expansion or compression of embedded domains occurs. This can significantly alter the mechanical response of the material. Typically, these phenomena are studied macroscopically, thus neglecting the underlying microscopic structure. Here we present the prototypical case of an elastic inclusion described by a mesoscale model, namely a coarse-grained phase-field crystal model. A spatially-dependent parameter is introduced into the free energy functional to control the local spacing of the lattice structure, effectively prescribing an eigenstrain. The stress field obtained for an elastic inclusion in a 2D triangular lattice is shown to match well with the analytic solution of the Eshelby inclusion problem.}
