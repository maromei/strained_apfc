"""
Contains general calculations operating on parameters or the fields
obtained by simulations.

F.e. the :py:mod:`calculations.initialize` module contains function
:py:func:`calculations.initialize.single_grain` which initialized the
domain of your simulations with a grain of a certian size.
Or :py:mod:`calculations.defect_detection` gives you tools to extract
centroids of defects / variations in the input array.
