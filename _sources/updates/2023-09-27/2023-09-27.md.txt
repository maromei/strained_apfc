## Summary / Notes

- did very basic comparisson between simulations with constant and varying $n_0$
- for $n_{0, \text{init}} = 0$:
  - amplitudes for varying $n_0$ generally larger
  - no difference in placement, movement and timescale of defects
- for $n_{0, \text{init}} = -0.03$:
  - dissolves from defects

## Plots

### n_0 = -0.03

stable 4 defects

The top boundary of the color-scale was made smaller to allow for more detail in
the image. All points above the new top boundary are displayed in white, which
might be a bit confusing.

Here is the same image without rescaling the boundary:
